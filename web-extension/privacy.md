## 🛡️ Our Privacy Commitment
EULAI was built with the conviction that your legal data is private. Unlike traditional AI assistants, EULAI operates on a **zero-server architecture**.

### 1. 100% Local Processing (No Cloud)
All analysis is performed directly in your browser using **WebGPU** via the MLC Web-LLM engine. 
- **No data transfer:** The text of the Terms of Service you analyze never leaves your machine.
- **No API calls:** We do not use external APIs (like OpenAI or Anthropic). The "brain" of EULAI lives entirely within your extension instance.

### 2. Zero Data Collection
- **No PII:** We do not collect names, emails, IP addresses, or any personally identifiable information.
- **No Tracking:** We do not track which websites you visit or which legal documents you analyze.
- **No Analytics:** There are no hidden trackers or telemetry scripts included in the package.

### 3. Transparent Permissions
To function properly, EULAI requires specific permissions:
- `activeTab` & `scripting`: To read the text content of the Terms of Service page **only when you click the "Analyze" button**.
- `storage`: To store your local preferences and the AI engine configuration.

### 4. Open Source Transparency
We believe in "Don't trust, verify." As an open-source project, our entire codebase is available for public audit. Anyone can verify that the extension functions exactly as described in this policy by reviewing our repository:

### 5. Third-Party Sharing
Since we never collect your data, we have **no data to sell, trade, or share** with third parties.
