terms.", "If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer.", "To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Vimeo agree that in the event that there are 10 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Vimeo by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 90-day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), then NAM will (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (or, if between 10 and 99 individual Requests are filed, a single batch of all those Requests, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests remaining after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“ **Batch Arbitration** ”).", "All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.", "To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM must appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“ **Administrative Arbitrator** ”).", "In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly.", "The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Vimeo.", "You and Vimeo agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.", "This Batch Arbitration provision may in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.", "You and Vimeo agree that any arbitration proceeding must be initiated within the applicable statute of limitation for the underlying claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.", "Likewise, you and Vimeo agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.", "The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of New York and will be selected by the parties from NAM’s roster of consumer arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.", "If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35 days of delivery of the Request, then NAM will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with NAM Rules.", "The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Covered Privacy Claim, including, without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except that all disputes regarding the subsection entitled “ *Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief* ,” including any claim that all or part of that subsection is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that that such subsection has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.", "The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any dispute.", "The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.", "The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.", "Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.", "Your responsibility to pay any NAM fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable NAM Rules.", "The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).", "Subject to the NAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.", "Whenever communicating with the arbitrator, the parties must include each other – for example, by including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails.", "To the extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by telephone conference call or email.", "Ex parte communications are not permitted with any arbitrator.", "You and Vimeo agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone

confidential.", "YOU AND VIMEO HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.", "YOU AND VIMEO AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THIS  [SECTION 11](https://vimeo.com/legal#disputes) , (A) EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS, AND (B) ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.", "Subject to the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim.", "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this paragraph are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Vimeo agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) will be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of New York.", "All other disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court.", "Neither you nor Vimeo are prevented from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.", "Notwithstanding the above, each party has the right to bring a dispute in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court.", "If one party files an arbitration that could be litigated in such a small claims court, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court.", "If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed.", "If requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall administratively close the arbitration so long as the proceedings are at an early stage and no hearing has occurred.", "Either party may also seek injunctive relief, such as a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, in a court of competent jurisdiction.", "Seeking such relief does not waive a party’s ability to arbitrate under the Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph will automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action.", "You have the right to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out of individual binding arbitration to  [arbitration-opt-out@vimeo.com](mailto:arbitration-opt-out@vimeo.com) , within 30 days after first

to the Arbitration Agreement (for an existing user), you will continue to be bound by any prior Arbitration Agreements to which you did not opt out.", "To validly opt out, your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to register your Vimeo account (or if no email address is associated with your Vimeo account, any valid email address where you can be contacted), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.", "If you opt out, Vimeo will also not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement, and all other parts of these Terms of Service will continue to apply to you.", "Opting out of the Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.",

changes to these Terms of Service) remain in full force and effect.", "Vimeo will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms of Service."]}
