IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n\nYou and Toodledo agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.\n\nThis Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.\n\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Toodledo as follows:\n\nInitial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach Toodledo's support department at info@toodledo.com. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Toodledo support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.\n\nBinding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including the Terms of Use' or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com ); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Toodledo at admin@toodledo.com.\n\nTo the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Toodledo will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Toodledo will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.\n\nThe parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\n\nIf you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America, and you and Toodledo agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Contra Costa county, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n\nClass Action Waiver: The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND Toodledo AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS USER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n\nException: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (\"intellectual property rights\" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.\n\n30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you use on Toodledo) written notice of your decision to opt out to Toodledo (admin@toodledo.com) with the subject line, \"ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.\" The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Toodledo also will not be bound by them.\n\nChanges to This Section: Toodledo will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Toodledo Terms of Use webService, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Toodledo Terms of Use webService or sent to you.\n\nChanges to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on \"Changes to This Section\" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled \u201cArbitration and Class Action Waiver,\u201d and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.\n\nSurvival: This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your Account or the Services.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.toodledo.com/info/privacy.php)  \u00b7  [Terms](https://www.toodledo.com/info/terms.php)  \u00b7  [Cookies](https://www.toodledo.com/info/cookies.php)  \u00b7  Copyright Toodledo \u00a9 2004-2026"}]}]}}

The easiest way to opt out is to use the unsubscribe link that you will find at the bottom of each communication.\n\nIf you see Toodledo\u2019s advertisements on websites and in social media, these may not be directed specifically at you, we might just have bid for the space. But we may specifically direct certain email promotions to you.\n\nWe also work with partners to try and promote the reach of our advertisements and use analytics and retargeting for this reason. We use Tracking Data to deliver relevant online advertising, including via websites and social media. For more information on Tracking Data, and in particular cookies, which also help us deliver website and social advertising that we believe is most relevant to you and to potential new customers of Toodledo, please see Cookies below.\n\n## Cookies\n\nYou can see from Advertising, Marketing and Your Communication Preferences above that cookies are a tool that we \u2013 and everyone one else who operates online \u2013 use for advertising. However, advertising is just one of the many reasons why cookies are used, and as you can see below, there are different types of cookies.\n\n **Strictly Functional Cookies** \nFirst and foremost, cookies help our websites work better. They help us work behind the scenes to make your customer experience a lot easier. You\u2019d miss a lot of these things if they were gone \u2013 like easily logging in and moving from page to page.\n\n **Performance Cookies** \nOther cookies collect information about how visitors use our websites, and measure how well the websites work \u2013 like whether a visitor gets an error message from our web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All of the information that these types of cookies collect is aggregated and used to improve how our websites works.\n\n **Advertising Cookies** \nAnd of course, there are cookies that collect information about your browsing habits in order to make any advertising that is delivered to you more relevant to you and your interests. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is then shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. This is also why when you\u2019ve been on one of our websites, you might see some tools that you previously looked at on our websites. This includes retargeting.\n\nCookies can also tell us if you have seen a specific advertisement, and how long it has been since you have seen it. This is helpful, because it means we can control the effectiveness of our advertisements and control the number of times people might be shown our advertisements. Cookies also help us understand if you\u2019ve opened a marketing email - we don\u2019t want to send you things that you don\u2019t read.\n\nAlmost all the cookies that relate to advertising are part of third party online advertising networks. If you\u2019d like to read about how you can control which advertisements you see online, see opt-out programs established by the Digital Advertising Alliance (United States), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. We do not control cookies which are set by advertising networks.\n\nYou can also set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.\n\nFor more information about the cookies we use, including who they belong to, their ID and why they are used,  [click here](https://www.toodledo.com/info/cookies.php) . We\u2019ve also included links to the third-party websites where you can go to find out more.\n\n## Third Party Links\n\nThe website and mobile application may provide links to other websites or resources, including apps developed by third parties using the Toodledo API that may integrate with our website and mobile application, over which Toodledo does not have control (\u201cExternal Websites\u201d). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Toodledo of those External Websites, and Toodledo is providing these links to you only as a convenience. We are not responsible for the content of those External Websites, and your use of External Websites is subject to their respective terms of use and privacy policies.\n\n## Data Security & Retention\n\nWe have put in place appropriate security measures designed to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. For example, we use encryption and password protection. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.\n\nWe will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it in the first place, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. If you cease using our website and mobile application for one (1) year, we will generally delete your data at that one (1) year anniversary from when you ceased use.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\n\nWe generally keep certain information about our customers (such as, Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) related to our customers' purchases for seven years after a transaction for tax purposes.\n\nIn some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data; see Your Legal Rights below for further information.\n\n## International Transfers\n\nThe information you enter on the website or mobile application or otherwise provide to Toodledo may be transferred and processed outside of the European Economic Area to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that of the European Union. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country in certain situations. By agreeing to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you agree to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America and to the processing of that information by Toodledo on servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy. We may adopt other means, such as entering into different certification programs such as the Privacy Shield under applicable law, in order to ensure adequate safeguards under the GDPR.\n\n## Your Legal Rights\n\nIf the GDPR applies to you because you are in the European Economic Area, you have certain rights in relation to your personal data:\n\n* The right to be informed \u2013 that\u2019s an obligation on us to inform you how we use your personal data (and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in this Privacy Policy);\n* The right of access \u2013 that\u2019s a right to make what\u2019s known as a \u2018data subject access request\u2019 for a copy of the personal data we hold about you;\n* The right to rectification \u2013 that\u2019s a right to make us correct personal data about you that may be incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your Account Settings);\n* The right to erasure (also known as the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019) \u2013 that\u2019s where in certain circumstances you can ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless there\u2019s an overriding legal reason we need to keep it);\n* The right to restrict processing \u2013 that\u2019s a right for you in certain circumstances to ask us to suspend processing personal data;\n* The right to data portability \u2013 that\u2019s a right for you to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file);\n* The right to object \u2013 that\u2019s a right for you to object to us processing your personal data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing); and\n* Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling \u2013 that\u2019s a right you have for us to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision making.\n\nThese rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us (see How to Contact Toodledo About Privacy).\n\nGenerally, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\n\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\n\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\nWe have appointed a data privacy manager who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the data privacy manager using the details in How to Contact Toodledo About Privacy below.\n\nFinally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so please contact us first.\n\n## How to Contact Toodledo About Privacy\n\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or would like to exercise any of your rights, even if you are not located in the European Economic Area, please contact us at:\n\nTitle or Role:  **Privacy Manager**\n\nE-Mail:  [gdpr@toodledo.com](mailto:gdpr@toodledo.com)\n\nPhone Number: +1 (786) 625-5350\n\n## Changes to this Privacy Policy\n\nToodledo may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Toodledo will post its updated Privacy Policy on our websites along with a change notice on the websites. If we make significant changes, we may also send registered users of our services a notice that this Privacy Policy has been changed. Toodledo encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this website, mobile application and/or services and/or your continued provision of personal data to us after the posting of such notice will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.toodledo.com/info/privacy.php)  \u00b7  [Terms](https://www.toodledo.com/info/terms.php)  \u00b7  [Cookies](https://www.toodledo.com/info/cookies.php)  \u00b7  Copyright Toodledo \u00a9 2004-2026"}]}]}}

A cookie has two components: the name and the content.\n\nCookies are installed (set) through instructions sent by a web server to a web browser (the application used to access a web site, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) or by using a client-side scripting language (such as Javascript). Cookies are \u201cpassive\u201d by nature, meaning they cannot contain software applications, cannot contain malware and cannot themselves access information from the device they are stored on.\n\nBy design, cookies can only be accessed by the same web site that installed them, whenever the user returns to that web site.\n\n### Cookie usage purposes\n\nCookies are used to improve the user experience of the Website, adapt some features to the preferences of each user, and ensure a smooth operation of the Website services.

Firstly, by browsing \u201cphpBB.com\u201d will cause the phpBB software to create a number of cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded on to your computer\u2019s web browser temporary files. The first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter \u201cuser-id\u201d) and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter \u201csession-id\u201d), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within \u201cphpBB.com\u201d and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience. \n\n We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing \u201cphpBB.com\u201d, though these are outside the scope of this document which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user (hereinafter \u201canonymous posts\u201d), registering on \u201cphpBB.com\u201d (hereinafter \u201cyour account\u201d) and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter \u201cyour posts\u201d). \n\n Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter \u201cyour user name\u201d), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter \u201cyour password\u201d) and a personal, valid email address (hereinafter \u201cyour email\u201d). Your information for your account at \u201cphpBB.com\u201d is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us. Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your email address required by \u201cphpBB.com\u201d during the registration process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of \u201cphpBB.com\u201d. In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated emails from the phpBB software. \n\n Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at \u201cphpBB.com\u201d, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with \u201cphpBB.com\u201d, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the \u201cI forgot my password\u201d feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your email, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.\n\n### advertisements\n\n[Need Hosting?](https://www.phpbb.com/hosting/)\n\n**[BlueHost.com](https://www.phpbb.com/hosting/r/bluehost-footer/)**  \u2022  [Web Hosting UK](http://www.webhosting.uk.com/)  \u2022  [HostMonster](http://www.hostmonster.com/track/phpbbsoftwareltd/footer)  \u2022  [FastDomain Hosting](http://hosting.fastdomain.com/track/phpbbsoftwareltd/footer)  \u2022  [*Advertise on phpBB.com*](https://www.phpbb.com/about/advertise/?sid=f817050219f0a734f827d86587519b55)\n\n\u00a9 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007  [phpBB Limited](https://www.phpbb.com/about/?sid=f817050219f0a734f827d86587519b55)\n\n[Privacy](https://www.phpbb.com/community/ucp.php?mode=privacy&sid=f817050219f0a734f827d86587519b55)  |  [Terms](https://www.phpbb.com/community/ucp.php?mode=terms&sid=f817050219f0a734f827d86587519b55)  |  [Contact Us](https://www.phpbb.com/about/contact_us.php?sid=f817050219f0a734f827d86587519b55)  |  [Advertise on www.phpbb.com](https://www.phpbb.com/about/advertise/?sid=f817050219f0a734f827d86587519b55)"}]}]}}

By using Nabble, you understand and accept the most recent version of this policy, which will be periodically updated. This document was last updated on April 03, 2015.\n\n## Information we collect\n\nWe collect information to provide better services to all of our users. We collect information in two ways:\n\n* **Information you give us.**  Nabble retains private and personal information only when it is voluntarily submitted by visitors via forms and emails.\n* **Information we get from your use of our services.**  We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them. This includes: \n\n  * **Cookies and anonymous identifiers.**  This site uses some unobtrusive cookies to store information on your computer. Some cookies on this site are essential, and the site won't work as expected without them. These cookies are set when you submit a form, login or interact with the site by doing something that goes beyond clicking on simple links. We also use some non-essential cookies to anonymously track visitors or enhance your experience of the site.\n  * **Log information.**  Nabble may collect and store certain information in server logs, including details of how you used our service, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, IP address, the date and time of your request and referral URL.\n\n## How we use the information we collect\n\nThe information we collect is used to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. This basically includes verification of identity, maintaining user preferences, monitoring web traffic, investigation of bugs and statistical analysis with the purpose of improving the user experience.\n\n## Anonymous Usage\n\nYou may use Nabble without divulging any information beyond what is technologically required to retrieve a web page. Such usage, however, will limit the availability of certain features, including maintaining an account.\n\n## Site Owners\n\nA Nabble \"site\" is a forum, blog, or any other application created on Nabble with its own subdomain. The user who creates a site owns it and can make the content public or private as he/she sees fit. This user may also download backups of the data for the site, and this will include any data that you have submitted to this site (except passwords, which are encrypted and truncated for security reasons).\n\n## Third Parties\n\nNabble utilizes certain third parties for the normal operation of our service. This includes, but is not limited to, providers of hosting, payment gateways, statistical analysis software and advertising networks. We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web site. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at  [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)  and Networking Advertising Initiative at  [www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) .\n\nPersonal information we collect is not shared with third parties except when approved by you or necessary for the delivery of the service. Information may likewise be divulged to aid in the investigation of illegal or forbidden activities and as required by law. Information may be transferred in the event that Nabble is acquired by another organization.\n\n[Help](http://s1.nabble.com/help/Index.jtp)  [Powered by](https://www.nabble.com/PoweredBy.jtp)  [Terms of Use](https://www.nabble.com/Terms.jtp)  [Privacy Policy](https://www.nabble.com/PrivacyPolicy.jtp)  [Contact Us](https://www.nabble.com/ContactUs.jtp) \n\u00a9 2005-2026 Nabble, LLC."}]}]}}

(\u201cAmazon\u201d). The information we collect is subject to the  [Amazon Privacy Notice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010) , except as otherwise stated in this notice. By visiting or using Goodreads.com and related services (the \u201cService\u201d), you are accepting the practices described in the Amazon Privacy Notice as supplemented by this notice (the \u201cPrivacy Notice\u201d). Please note that, if you have an account on www.amazon.com, information gathered by Goodreads may be correlated with any personal information that Amazon.com has and used by Goodreads and Amazon to improve the services we offer.\n\n## User Content and Messages\n\nThe Service allows you to post User Content, as defined in our  [Terms of Use](https://www.goodreads.com/about/terms) . Any User Content you post becomes available to the public via the Service. User Content includes, but is not limited to, reviews, comments, and visual content. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.\n\nGoodreads takes reasonable measures to keep messages that you send to other Members through the Service private between you and the recipient. However, even if you have deleted the message from your Goodreads inbox or outbox, copies of the message may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored the message.\n\n## E-mail\n\nBy providing Goodreads your e-mail address you consent to us sending you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your e-mail address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features, notices of member-initiated content, or special offers (\u201cOther Messages\u201d). If you do not want to receive Other Messages, you may opt out by changing your e-mail preference settings in the account settings section of Goodreads.com after you have signed in using your personal password. Opting out may prevent you from receiving e-mail messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.\n\n## Privacy Settings\n\nYour name is used when you invite another person to join Goodreads, or when you request to add another member to your friends list. To the extent that you do not wish to have your name shared in this manner, you should not make use of these services. You can modify, delete, and set your privacy setting for information you provide us any time in the account settings section of Goodreads.com after you have signed in using your personal password.\n\n## Your Choices About Your Information\n\nYou may access or change your information and preferences at any time in the account settings section of Goodreads.com once you have signed in with your personal password. For example, you can control which actions, if any, will appear on your update feed, whether to display your e-mail address, whether to display your last name, and what sort of e-mail notifications you will receive from the Service. In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal information. To do so, you may visit  [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit)  and navigate to the \u201cSettings\u201d tab or  [contact us](https://www.goodreads.com/about/contact_us) . You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Goodreads, in which case Goodreads may not be able to provide certain services to you.\n\n## Cookies and Other Identifiers\n\nTo enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve the Service, we use cookies and other identifiers. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our  [Cookies](https://www.goodreads.com/about/cookies_notice)  notice.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe use your personal information to display interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you.

To learn more, please read our  [Interest Based Ads](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/Goodreads-Interest-Based-Ads-Notice)  notice.\n\n## Children's Privacy\n\nProtecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Goodreads does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Goodreads. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please  [contact us](https://www.goodreads.com/about/contact_us) .\n\n## Additional State-Specific Privacy Disclosures\n\nClick  [here](https://www.goodreads.com/about/ccpa)  to read additional state-specific privacy disclosures as required under applicable laws.\n\n## Changes to Our Privacy Policy\n\nIf we change this Privacy Notice, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\n\n### International transfers\n\nSome of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:\n\nWe will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.\n\nWhere we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.\n\n### Data security\n\nWe have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\n\nWe have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.\n\n### Data retention\n\nWe will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see \u201crequest erasure\u201d below for further information.\n\nIn some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n\n### Specific legal rights for users located in the  [EEA region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)  (GDPR)\n\nYou may contact our data protection officer at dpo@softnews.ro for more information or to exercise any of these rights:\n\n1. Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\n\n2. Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.\n\n3. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.\n\n4. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\n\n5. Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\n6. Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\n **Exercising these rights** \n\nUse our  [DSR (data subject request) form](https://www.softpedia.com/dsr/)  or send an email to dpo@softnews.ro\n\nYou also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the  [ANSPDCP](https://www.dataprotection.ro/) , the Romanian supervisory authority for data protection issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns about data protection before you approach the authority so please contact us in the first instance.\n\n **No fee usually required** \n\nYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\n\n **What we may need from you** \n\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\n\n **Time limit to respond** \n\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\n### Specific legal rights for users located in California, United States of America (CCPA)\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a71798.100 et. seq. (\u201cCCPA\u201d), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described below.\n\n1. California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email at dpo@softnews.ro\n\n* Know the ways in which we acquire, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information;\n* Know the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold;\n* Request the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions;\n* Not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights\n\n2. California residents also have the right to opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of their Personal Information. We put \u201csale\u201d in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as \u201csales,\u201d even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. . If we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information. Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren\u2019t \u201csales,\u201d such as with our Service Providers.\n\n3. Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your Personal Information for a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:\n\n* Identifiers\n* Commercial information\n* Geolocation data\n* Internet or other electronic network activity information\n* Professional information\n* Education information\n* Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.\n\n4. Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have \u201csold\u201d (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:\n\n* Identifiers\n* Commercial information\n* Geolocation data\n* Internet or other electronic network activity information\n* Professional information\n* Education information\n* Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.\n\n5. You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent\u2019s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.\n\n6. You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any of your rights.\n\n7. California's \"Shine the Light\" law permits customers who are California residents to request certain details about how a business shares their personal information as defined by \"Shine the Light\" with third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for those third parties' or affiliates' own direct marketing purposes. California customers may request information about our compliance with this law by contacting us by e-mail at dpo@softnews.ro or by mail at the address set forth in Section 11 above. Any such mail inquiry must include \"California Privacy Rights Request\" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email or mail address.\n\n### Opt-outs\n\n* [Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)\n* [Google Ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads)\n* [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ro/)\n* [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)\n* [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/)\n\nfeedback"}]}]}}
